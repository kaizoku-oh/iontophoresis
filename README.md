# TODO:

[] Verify that the code is working as expected by measuring the output voltage with multimeter

[] Add EEPROM storage for tracking session numbers

[] Add a serial command interface to start/pause/stop session, change voltage output, reading EEPROM data

[] Add a GUI on top of the serial command interface
